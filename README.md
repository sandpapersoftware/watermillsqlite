# Watermill SQLite3 Driver Pack

Golang SQLite3 driver pack for <https://watermill.io> event dispatch framework. Drivers satisfy the following interfaces:

- [message.Publisher](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill@v1.4.6/message#Publisher)
- [message.Subscriber](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill@v1.4.6/message#Subscriber)
- [middleware.ExpiringKeyRepository](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill@v1.4.6/message/router/middleware#ExpiringKeyRepository) for message de-duplicator

SQLite3 does not support querying `FOR UPDATE`, which is used for row locking when subscribers in the same consumer group read an event batch in official Watermill SQL PubSub implementations. Current architectural decision is to lock a consumer group offset using `unixepoch()+lockTimeout` time stamp. While one consumed message is processing per group, the offset lock time is extended by `lockTimeout` periodically by `time.Ticker`. If the subscriber is unable to finish the consumer group batch, other subscribers will take over the lock as soon as the grace period runs out. A time lock fulfills the role of a traditional database network timeout that terminates transactions when its client disconnects.

## Vanilla ModernC Driver
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/wmsqlitemodernc)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/wmsqlitemodernc)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/wmsqlitemodernc)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/dkotik/watermillsqlite/wmsqlitemodernc/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/dkotik/watermillsqlite/wmsqlitemodernc)

```sh
go get -u github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/wmsqlitemodernc
```

The ModernC driver is compatible with the Golang standard library SQL package. It works without CGO. Has fewer dependencies than the ZombieZen variant.

```go
import (
	"database/sql"
	"github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/wmsqlitemodernc"
	_ "modernc.org/sqlite"
)

db, err := sql.Open("sqlite", ":memory:?journal_mode=WAL&busy_timeout=1000&cache=shared")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
// limit the number of concurrent connections to one
// this is a limitation of `modernc.org/sqlite` driver
db.SetMaxOpenConns(1)
defer db.Close()

pub, err := wmsqlitemodernc.NewPublisher(db, wmsqlitemodernc.PublisherOptions{
	InitializeSchema: true, // create tables for used topics
})
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
sub, err := wmsqlitemodernc.NewSubscriber(db, wmsqlitemodernc.SubscriberOptions{
	InitializeSchema: true, // create tables for used topics
})
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
// ... follow guides on <https://watermill.io>
```

## Advanced ZombieZen Driver
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/wmsqlitezombiezen)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/wmsqlitezombiezen)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/wmsqlitezombiezen)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/dkotik/watermillsqlite/wmsqlitezombiezen/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/dkotik/watermillsqlite/wmsqlitezombiezen)

```sh
go get -u github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/wmsqlitezombiezen
```

The ZombieZen driver abandons the standard Golang library SQL conventions in favor of [the more orthogonal API and higher performance potential](https://crawshaw.io/blog/go-and-sqlite). Under the hood, it uses ModernC SQLite3 implementation and does not need CGO. Advanced SQLite users might prefer this driver.

It is about **9 times faster** than the ModernC variant when publishing messages. It is currently more stable due to lower level control. It is faster than even the CGO SQLite variants on standard library interfaces, and with some tuning should become the absolute speed champion of persistent message brokers over time. Tuned SQLite is [~35% faster](https://sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html) than the Linux file system.

```go
import "github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/wmsqlitezombiezen"

// &cache=shared is critical, see: https://github.com/zombiezen/go-sqlite/issues/92#issuecomment-2052330643
connectionDSN := ":memory:?journal_mode=WAL&busy_timeout=1000&cache=shared")
conn, err := sqlite.OpenConn(connectionDSN)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
defer conn.Close()

pub, err := wmsqlitezombiezen.NewPublisher(conn, wmsqlitezombiezen.PublisherOptions{
	InitializeSchema: true, // create tables for used topics
})
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
sub, err := wmsqlitezombiezen.NewSubscriber(connectionDSN, wmsqlitezombiezen.SubscriberOptions{
	InitializeSchema: true, // create tables for used topics
})
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
// ... follow guides on <https://watermill.io>
```

## Development Roadmap

- [ ] make sure basic tests can pass by anticipating duplicates caused by lock timeouts
- [ ] Three-Dots Labs acceptance requests:
    - [x] may be worth adding test like (but please double check if it makes sense here - it was problematic use case for Postgres): https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill-sql/blob/master/pkg/sql/pubsub_test.go#L466 ([won't fix, see discussion](https://github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/issues/10#issuecomment-2813855209))
    - [x] publish - you can get context from message (will better work with tracing etc.) - it's tricky when someone is publishing multiple messages - usually we just get context from the first ([won't fix, see discussion](https://github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/issues/11)
    - [x] NIT: it would be nice to add abstraction over queries (like in SQL) - so someone could customize it, but not very important ([saved to later](https://github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/issues/13))
    - [x] NIT: return io.ErrClosedPipe - maybe better to define custom error for that? ClosedPipe probably a bit different kind of error ([fixed](https://github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/commit/e09a9365230f04b14b0d63c76bc8a9c8e94436b7))
    - [x] would be nice to add benchmark - may be good thing for sqlite -> https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill-benchmark feel free to make draft PR, we can replace repo later ([opened pull request](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill-benchmark/pull/10))
    - [x] does it  make sense to have two implementations -> if so, guide which to choose for people ([fixed](https://github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/commit/74d00ca378a4130b53676dc64a8dfeb277cabc34) and marked the first as vanilla and second as advanced)
    - [x] NewPublisher(db SQLiteDatabase -> it may be nice if it can accept just transaction like in https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill-sql/blob/master/pkg/sql/publisher.go#L54 - it allows to add events transactionally ([fixed](https://github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/issues/10))
    - [x] options.LockTimeout < time.Second - rationale for second? ([explanation added](https://github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/commit/240ec78d2c0e85af3ba84054dbb12621a6aeeae3))
    - [x] consumer groups - it would be nice to make dynamic based on topic - usually we have closure in config that receives topic,
    - [x] ackChannel:   s.NackChannel, - typo? ([fixed](https://github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/commit/ae70e4c4989d07ae0d58426d623d48af342a2d10) - yes)
    - [x] adding some logging may be useful for future - most trace or debug (everything what happens per message) - info for rare events ([partially](https://github.com/dkotik/watermillsqlite/issues/12))
- [ ] Add clean up routines for removing old messages from topics.
    - [ ] wmsqlitemodernc.CleanUpTopics
    - [ ] wmsqlitezombiezen.CleanUpTopics
- [x] Finish time-based lock extension when:
    - [x] sending a message to output channel
    - [x] waiting for message acknowledgement
- [x] Pass official implementation acceptance tests:
    - [x] ModernC
        - [x] tests.TestPublishSubscribe
        - [x] tests.TestConcurrentSubscribe
        - [x] tests.TestConcurrentSubscribeMultipleTopics
        - [x] tests.TestResendOnError
        - [x] tests.TestNoAck
        - [x] tests.TestContinueAfterSubscribeClose
        - [x] tests.TestConcurrentClose
        - [x] tests.TestContinueAfterErrors
        - [x] tests.TestPublishSubscribeInOrder
        - [x] tests.TestPublisherClose
        - [x] tests.TestTopic
        - [x] tests.TestMessageCtx
        - [x] tests.TestSubscribeCtx
